## Given flags access

    uint32_t (*given_flag_model)(void *model, uint32_t id);

Returns true if given flag is set for model parameter with given OSDI id. 
If id is not a valid model parameter, returns false. 

    uint32_t (*given_flag_instance)(void *inst, uint32_t id);
    
Returns true if given flag is set for instance parameter with given OSDI id.
If id is not a valid instance parameter, returns false. 


## Loading Jacobian entries into an array

These functions are used for extracting Jacobian contributions of a single instance. 
They can be used for checking whether an instance is converged. 

    uint32_t num_resistive_jacobian_entries;
    
Number of resistive Jacobian entries. Should be <= num_jacobian_entries. 
This is the number of Jacobian entries with JACOBIAN_ENTRY_RESIST flag set. 

    uint32_t num_reactive_jacobian_entries;

Number of reactive Jacobian entries. Should be <= num_jacobian_entries. 
This is the number of Jacobian entries with JACOBIAN_ENTRY_REACT flag set. 

    void write_jacobian_array_resist(void *inst, void* model, double* destination);

Writes resistive Jacobian contributions to an array of doubles of length num_resistive_jacobian_entries. 
The entries appear in the same order as in jacobian_entries. 
Entries with JACOBIAN_ENTRY_RESIST flag not set are left out. 

    void write_jacobian_array_react(void *inst, void* model, double* destination);
    
Writes reactive Jacobian contributions to an array of doubles of length num_reactive_jacobian_entries. 
The entries appear in the same order as in jacobian_entries. 
Entries with JACOBIAN_ENTRY_REACT flag not set are left out. 


## List of model inputs

Obtains the list of input quantities to a model (just like they appear in Verilog-A code). 
This information is useful when checking whether an instance is converged. 
Only inputs that cause nonlinear response are listed. 

    uint32_t num_inputs;

Number of model inputs. 

    OsdiNodePair* inputs;

Model inputs as node pairs. If a node in a node pair is UINT32_MAX, 
it corresponds to global ground node. 


## Loading Jacobian entries with an offset

These functions are used for adding Jacobian contributions of a single instance
to an address shifted by an offset from the given Jacobian entry pointers. 
This is useful in analyses like HB where we need to evaluate the circuit at multiple 
timepoints and store the results in vectors. 

    void load_jacobian_with_offset_resist(void *inst, void* model, size_t offset);

Like load_jacobian_resist(), except that it adds an offset to the Jacobian entry pointer. 
Offset of 1 means that the address in memory where the entry is added to is 
the address pointed to by the Jacobian entry pointer increased by the size of one double (8). 

    void load_jacobian_with_offset_react(void *inst, void* model, size_t offset);

Like load_jacobian_react(), except that it adds an offset to the Jacobian entry pointer. 
Assumes alpha=1. Offset of 1 means that the address in memory where the entry is added to is 
the address pointed to by the Jacobian entry pointer increased by the size of one double (8). 


# OSDI 0.4 symbols in the generated dynamic library. 

    OSDI_DESCRIPTOR_SIZE
    
Size of the OSDI descriptor in bytes. Can be used by simulators supporting only 
OSDI 0.3 for traversing the array of descriptors. The first part of the descriptor 
is compatible with OSDI 0.3.
